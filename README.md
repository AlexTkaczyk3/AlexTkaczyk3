- 👋 Hi, I’m @AlexTkaczyk3
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning, computer vision, artificial intelligence, virtual reality interfaces, and just about anything and everything as long as I get to program.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any kind of project, even those in which I don't have much experience on. As long as I can learn it, then I'll be willing to help!
